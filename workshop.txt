description=[h1] The definitive Edition of the transmog mod [/h1]
description=After months, I finally made a transmog mod that works in [b]single-player[/b] and [b]multiplayer[/b] without requiring complex setups and external dependencies. The real successor of my Fashionoid mod.

description=This version works out of the box and is compatible with most clothing mods! And it supports up to [b] 5000 custom items of modded and vanilla clothing! [/b]

description=[h1]Immersive Mode Option[/h1]
description=[b]When you enable the Immersive Mode from the sandbox settings, you can transmog only to the items you have found, and if you die, don't worry! You will keep your list of found transmogs :D[/b]

description=[h1]Know issues and limitations[/h1]
description=[b]-[/b] To ensure your hair is visible when you hide your hat, I had to write code to edit all headgear, so if you see the wrong hat icons, this is why. I can't fix the issue, sadly.
description=[b]-[/b] Some item combinations will look weird or with clipping. That's a limitation of the game engine, and I can't do much about it
description=[b]-[/b] This mod works best on a new save, and on a new server. No guarantee that it work on existing saves
description=[b]-[/b] No backpack transmogs, yet. Something changed in the game code, and I can't hide/edit backpacks but don't worry. I'll find a way one day.
description=[b]-[/b] Opening the transmog menu will make the game lag a bit, this happens because the game is trying to load all the possible items, this is not something I can fix.
