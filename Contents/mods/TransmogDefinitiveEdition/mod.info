description=[h1]Know issues and limitations[/h1]
description=[b]-[/b] No backpack transmogs, yet. Something changed in the game code, and I can't hide/edit backpacks but don't worry. I'll find a way one day.
description=[b]-[/b] To ensure your hair is visible when you hide your hat, I had to write code to edit all headgear, so if you see the wrong hat icons, this is why. I can't fix the issue, sadly.
description=[b]-[/b] Some item combinations will look weird or with clipping. That's a limitation of the game engine, and I can't do much about it
